Adaptive Image
http://drupal.org/project/adaptive_image
====================================


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The Adaptive image module provides device-appropriate versions of images from your fields.
You can activate adaptive images by adding an adaptive effect to any of your image styles.

The used technique is derived from http://adaptive-images.com/ by Matt Wilcox.
The hard work is done by Drupal core no need for any additional rewrites.
If image styles work on your website, this module will too.
